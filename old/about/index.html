            <h1 class="f1 lh-title">Hi, I'm Paul</h1>
            <p>
               <b>TL;DR:</b> I'm an MS in computer science candidate @ UIUC. I have a deep passion for learning and building useful things.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2013, I graduated with a BSE in biomedical engineering from the University of Iowa. 
                Early on during my undergrad, I spent my time volunteering and doing research. One summer I worked at the Mayo Clinic 
                as a research assistant in Neuropathology, which was an incredibly rewarding experience. I was originally intending to pursue a medical degree, 
                but I fell in love with building things after I started a company during my junior year. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Up until that point, the only programming experience 
                I had was basic C and Matlab. Entering my senior year I decided to add a computer science minor and filled 
                my schedule with CS and bioinformatics classes; basically, any class that involved programming and allowed 
                me to graduate in time. I went to a couple hackathons that year where I learned so much more than I ever
                had in a single class. I applied for grad programs in CS and was luckily admitted into the program at UIUC.
            </p>
            <p>
                At UIUC I'm advised by <a class="near-black" href="http://sanmi.cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Prof. Sanmi Koyejo</a> in the AI department. I spent my first semester as a CS 101 TA teaching Python
                and Matlab to freshman engineering students. I wanted to gain more hands-on experience so the next semester I worked
                as a research assistant for <a class="near-black" href="http://healtheng.illinois.edu/people/thenkurussi-kesh-kesavadas/" target="_blank">Prof. Kesh</a> in the Health Care Engineering Systems Center. I was contributing to an open source 
                project called <a class="near-black" href="https://physiology.kitware.com/" target="_blank">Pulse</a>. It's a physiology simulation engine and I contributed simulations of 3 valvular heart defects. My work was
                accepted as a <a class="near-black" href="https://blog.kitware.com/kitware-at-the-engineering-in-medicine-and-biology-conference/" target="_blank">poster at the 40th International Engineering in Medicine and Biology Conference.</a> There's an exciting future
                in the physiology simulation space and a tremendous opportunity for human health impact. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                That summer, I interned at <a class="near-black" href="https://www.uptake.com/" target="_blank">Uptake</a>, a Chicago
                based startup, as a software engineer. I worked on the competitive 
                intelligence team building experimental features and I incorporated Node-RED and Orange 
                into Uptake's platform allowing data science workflows to be built with no code. Industrial IoT is going to be
                a large space with customers realizing immediate returns. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For my Fall 2018 semester, I began consulting for OmniLife.ai, a startup out of Iowa City focused on improving
                clinical efficiency in transplant. I previously worked for them as an intern after I graduated from UIOWA and
                saw first-hand how technology could improve clinicians abilities ultimately improving patient outcomes. 
                I primarily function as an ML researcher working on their SBIR Phase II research objectives. I'm building models
                that will ultimately reduce organ offer decision times and improve long-term graft survival. The ultimate hope
                is to improve outcomes across the transplant continuum improving patient quality of life.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a lot I want to accomplish in the future. For now, I'm awaiting the <a class="near-black" href="https://medium.com/@KapilGuptaMD/the-inevitability-of-success-23c878ddc5c9" target="_blank">inevitable</a>
                through experimentation.
